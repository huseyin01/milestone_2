# Sentiment Analysis for Amazon Reviews: Milestone-2 Report 

# 1. Introduction
  
  Sentiment analysis of product reviews is one of the most popular implementations of NLP (natural language processing). 
  In this analysis, I want to study the correlation between the Amazon product reviews and the rating of the products 
  given by the customers. I used traditional machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks. 
  Seven different traditional machine learning algorithms used with six different bag of words methods (CountVectorizer, 
  TfIdfVectorizer, HashingVectorizer, PCA with SMOTE Combination, Truncated SVD with SMOTE Combination, Word2Vec).
